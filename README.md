# 📊 Sales Data – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Python_Project

This project performs an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Sales dataset using Python in Google Colab.
The goal of the analysis is to understand **customer demographics**, **purchasing behavior**, and **sales performance** across multiple segments such as gender, age group, state, marital status, occupation, and product category.

---

## 📁 Project Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### **1. Importing Required Libraries**

The analysis begins by importing essential Python libraries such as:

* **Pandas** for data manipulation
* **NumPy** for numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizations

These libraries form the foundation for data cleaning and exploratory insights.

---

### **2. Loading the Dataset**

The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
Basic checks like `head()`, `shape`, and `info()` are performed to understand:

* Number of rows and columns
* Data types
* Presence of missing values
* Basic structure of the dataset

---

### **3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

A series of preprocessing steps are applied to ensure clean and analysis-ready data:

* Handling missing values
* Removing irrelevant or redundant columns
* Adjusting data types where required
* Creating new categorical columns such as **Age Group** for better segmentation

This prepares the dataset for meaningful and accurate analysis.

### **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The exploratory section focuses on uncovering trends across different dimensions of the data.

---

### **4.1. Analysis Based on Gender**

* Count of orders placed by each gender
* Total amount spent by each gender
* Visualization: **Countplot** and **Barplot**
* Insight: Female customers show higher purchase frequency and spending.

---

### **4.2. Analysis Based on Age Group**

* Orders grouped by **Age Group** and **Gender**
* Spending patterns across age segments
* Visualization: Countplots and bar charts
* Insight: Customers in the **26–35 years** bracket form the largest and most valuable segment.

---

### **4.3. State-wise Analysis**

* Total orders by state
* Total sales amount generated by each state
* Visualization using Seaborn barplots
* Insight: Highest orders originate from **Uttar Pradesh**, **Maharashtra**, and **Karnataka**.

---

### **4.4. Marital Status Analysis**

* Order distribution by **marital status** and **gender**
* Amount spent by each marital group
* Insight: Married women contribute significantly to overall sales.

---

### **4.5. Analysis Based on Occupation**

* Orders grouped by occupation type
* Amount generated from different professions
* Visualization: Barplots
* Insight: Highest participation from customers working in **IT**, **Healthcare**, and **Aviation**.

---

### **4.6. Product Category Analysis**

* Total orders across major product categories
* Total amount contributed by each category
* Visualization using barplots
* Insight: Top-performing categories include
  **Food**, **Clothing & Apparel**, and **Electronics & Gadgets**.

---

### **4.7. Product ID Analysis**

* Identifying top-ordered product IDs
* Helps in understanding product-level demand
* Visualization: Barplots

---

## 📌 Final Conclusion

The EDA highlights the key customer segment contributing to the highest sales:

**Married women aged 26–35 years, residing in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, or Karnataka, working mainly in IT, Healthcare, or Aviation, and purchasing from Food, Clothing/Apparel, and Electronics categories.**

This customer group forms the core revenue driver for the business according to the dataset.
